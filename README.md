# Covid-19---Cleaning-Data  

**INTRODUCTION**

The core objective of this project was to utilize SQL to analyze a sizable dataset tracking the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across more than 200 countries, 
with the goal of identifying trends, correlations, and insights that could inform public health response.
The dataset consisted of over 85,000 rows of country-level records across multiple categories - total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, and other related attributes.
It spanned from January 2020 through April 2021, covering all major infection waves globally.


**SKILLS**

The project called for advanced SQL skills to handle significant data manipulation and analysis. Core competencies included:
- Expertly filtering, joining, aggregating, and processing large datasets
- Employing window functions, CTEs, and other advanced constructs 
- Designing queries that identify trends and meaningful patterns in data
- Executing complex analysis while optimizing query performance 
- Visualizing data through charts, dashboards, and geospatial mapping

Additionally, strong working knowledge of epidemiology and public health principles was beneficial for contextualizing insights. 

**TOOL UTILIZED**

The backend technology leveraged was SQL Server Management Studio. SQL was used to extract, transform, and load the COVID dataset, then conduct exploratory analysis to generate reports, visualizations, and predictive models. Supplementary technologies included Tableau for interactive dashboards and Power BI for geographic mapping of case rates.

**RESULTS** 

Through SQL analysis, this project achieved multiple impactful outcomes:

- Pinpointed the highest case and mortality rate countries each month 
- Produced global time-series visualizations of pandemic waves and mortality
- Identified risk factors like population, urban density, climate, etc.
- Isolated dates and effectiveness of policy interventions  
- Predicted future hotspots based on regression analysis
- Created internationally comparative metric - "Pandemic Resilience Index" 

The analysis yielded actionable and previously hidden insights into COVID-19 growth trajectories while underscoring SQL's capabilities for knowledge discovery. This project demonstrated how data science can guide evidence-based pandemic response through early warning systems, predictive tracking, and risk identification. The analytical methodology and visualization tools developed could assist policymakers to deploy resources for maximal community impact.
